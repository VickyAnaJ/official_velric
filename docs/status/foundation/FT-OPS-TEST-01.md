# FT-OPS-TEST-01

## Metadata
- FT_ID: FT-OPS-TEST-01
- Owner: anajaramillo
- Status: [WIP]
- Linked Slices: SLICE-OPS-01, SLICE-OPS-03

## What this foundation task does (one sentence, plain language)
Provides slice-neutral deterministic test harness and fixture conventions shared by multiple slices.

## Scope/Contract
- Define deterministic unit/integration test harness contract and fixture boundaries.
- Define coverage-threshold enforcement contract shared across slices.
- No user-visible incident behavior implementation.
- No slice-specific business logic.

## Activity Log
- Claimed during Step 3.2 dependency discovery for `SLICE-OPS-01`.
- Initial contract established; implementation deferred to Step 3.5 prompts.

## Verification Evidence
- Claim recorded in `docs/STATUS.md` Foundation Task Registry.
- Linked from `docs/status/slices/SLICE-OPS-01.md` dependency output.

## Closure
- Result: In Progress.
- Completion evidence pending implementation and verification in later gates.
